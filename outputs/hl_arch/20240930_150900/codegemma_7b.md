**DeepFaceLab Architecture Overview**

**File Structure:**

The DeepFaceLab repository is organized into several key directories and files:

- **deepfacelab:** Contains the core DeepFaceLab library, including the `main.py` script, deep learning models, and face conversion algorithms.
- **datasets:** Stores pre-processed facesets of various celebrities.
- **utils:** Provides utility functions used throughout the project.
- **config.py:** Holds configuration settings for the model and training process.
- **README.md:** Provides an overview of the project and instructions for use.

**Components:**

- **Face Extraction:** Extracts faces from input images using a face detector.
- **Face Alignment:** Aligns faces to a standard pose for accurate conversion.
- **Face Swapping:** Uses a deep learning model to swap faces between two individuals.
- **Video Processing:** Allows users to apply face swaps to videos.

**Interactions:**

- The `main.py` script serves as the entry point for the application.
- It takes user input, configures the model, and performs face swapping operations.
- Other files within the `deepfacelab` directory handle specific tasks, such as face extraction, alignment, and swapping.

**Key Files and Directories:**

- **main.py:** The main application script.
- **deepfacelab/face_swapping.py:** Responsible for face swapping operations.
- **deepfacelab/face_alignment.py:** Performs face alignment.
- **datasets/**: Pre-processed facesets of celebrities.
