The provided `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` file contains a GitHub issue template for the DeepFaceLab project. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

1. **Expected behavior**: This section provides a detailed description of what the user is trying to do and what they expect the program to output. It helps the maintainers understand the context of the issue and what they are trying to achieve.
2. **Actual behavior**: This section describes the actual behavior of the program, including any error messages or screenshots that may be relevant. The user should provide as much detail as possible about what happened and how it differs from their expected output.
3. **Steps to reproduce**: This section provides instructions on how to reproduce the issue. It helps the maintainers understand the steps required to reproduce the problem and troubleshoot it more efficiently.
4. **Other relevant information**: This section provides additional context about the issue, such as the operating system and Python version used by the user, as well as any other relevant information that may be helpful in understanding the issue.
5. **File: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md**: This is the GitHub issue template file for the DeepFaceLab project. It provides guidelines for creating an issue and describes the structure of the codebase using Graphviz syntax. The output should include high-level relationships between components, connections between classes, functions, and modules, and groupings of components in subgraphs where appropriate. The template file also ensures that the output is valid Graphviz syntax and can be rendered without any errors.
6. **Please generate a `.dot` file**: This section asks the user to generate a `.dot` file that accurately represents the structure and interactions of the key components within the codebase. The `.dot` file should include high-level relationships between components, connections between classes, functions, and modules, and groupings of components in subgraphs where appropriate.

Overall, the issue template is designed to help maintainers understand the context of the issue more easily and provide a clear and concise way for users to report issues with the codebase.
